This branch is the new, much better version of the Impermanence of Space, an Ethereum-based DMMOG. Unfortunately, it's basically been a total rewrite, and many things don't work at all. Feel free to try working on it, or at least peek at the code. (I'd actually go as far as to call it mostly good.) 

If you want to see a theoretically more advanced version, check the "master" branch, but be warned it is currently nonfunctional.

Be warned this is _old_ code, and there's probably things that broke due to Ethereum itself advancing.

Requirements:

wzrd, onchange, browserify. Older versions require beefy, instead.

Start a test node at _8555_. This is not the normal RPC, as it will automatically create a couple large contracts on load.

Go to localhost:9966.

You can now look around, but unfortunately there's not much else to do right now.
