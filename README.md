This branch is the doomed, dysfunctional tech demo version of the Impermanence of Space, an Ethereum-based DMMOG. The code is a mess, in addition to not working. Feel free to try to fix it, but at the moment it's just as-is. 

See the "develop" branch for a far better, if theoretically lesss featureful, version.

Requirements:

beefy 
onchange (from npm)

Usage instructions.

Have a test node running with an rpc of localhost:8545.
./run.sh
Go to localhost:9966 (or wherever beefy is.)
in javascript console:
`createUniverse()`
