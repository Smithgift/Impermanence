INSTRUCTIONS:

Starting:

1. Go to a contract that is NOT galaxy.sol and Run Active Contract.
   If you run galaxy.sol, or all contracts, it won't deploy.
2. Run jsonhack.sh. This both links a working binary for galaxy.sol and sticks 
   a functioning abi in abi.js (which actually contains the binary, too.)
3. Cut and paste the sandbox id into the relevant function in index.html.
4. Start http-server in frontend2.
5. Navigate on a browser to <whereeverthisis>.on.ether.camp:8080/
6. (optional) Open up a broswer console to see hillarious debug messages.

ACTUAL USE:

1. Enter a system name in the box and press Go!
2. It will ask you if you want to make a system. Press YES!!!
   Technical note: This generates a system based on a deterministic seed:
   the hash of the name. For example, Sol always has four rifts and two 
   habitable planets.
3. The system should generate and load in a few seconds. Click on a lower-case
   o. These are inhabited planets, as it will tell you.
4. Click on "Construct CRaNE" to build your own personal 
   Cargo Reconnaissance and Naught Else vessel. Give it a wacky name!
5. Things you can do with your CRaNE!
   a) Click on Launch! and then click on another sector to sent your ship!
      Technical note: Movement. takes energy based on the manhattan distance
      to the destination, using a way-cool system to have
      realtime energy with in a world with discrete blocks. Check it out!
   b) Mine things! Go to a Rift, asteriod, or monolith and click mine resources
      Then wait. Asteriods are minable, on average 16 blocks, rifts 32, and
      monoliths 256.
      Technical note: The mining system is probabilistic, but is also 
      deterministic so that a prospector doesn't need to spend a single wei
      in unsuccessful mining attempts (ignoring latency.) It also discourages
      race situations, as every miner has a different "roll", though it does
      not prevent them.
   c) Bring resources to a planet and use them to upgrade the system or your
      ship. Upgraded tech levels allow all ship upgrades to be more efficient.
      Helpful note: Don't want to wait? Cheat with galaxy.cheatCargo().
   d) Engage in faster-than-light travel! Create a link with an unobtanium orb
      on an empty spot to create wormhole.
      Note: The system-to-system travel code is possibly broken, but you can
      try it anyway.
   e) Blow stuff up! You'll need to have an enemy. galaxy.transferShip(<some shipID>, foe)
      will give you one. Select it and attack!
   f) Mess around with the console. galaxy gives you access to the galaxy.

THINGS I WISHED TO DO:

Interstellar trade, based on galactic zones (one byte of system hash).
Multiple forms of FTL (short-range hyperspace, difficult to make wormholes,
                       extremely difficult omnigate to anywhere)
End-game megastructures (To blow up the sun, disintegrate all the fleet in a 
                         sector, or go anywhere.)
Way to win (Ascension Gate built on a system's sun, that would permanently 
            record the winners, but take away their high-tech worlds.)
Autopilot. (It's sorta there!)
Computer controlled empires (Run in client-side JS. A guild might run one, say.)

CONCLUSION:

This was fun. I was intending to make The Impermanence of Space a real thing,
long before this hackathon. I signed up the night before it started, and 
rather than taking a more complete project, I rebuilt this from the ground up.

Hackathons force you to get things done. This is why they are hackathons and not
elegathons.

In the future, I plan to rebuild the frontend from the ground up again. One of 
of my main issues was the flaws in my tools. Much of my time was spent 
compensating for technical issues. In particular, I have never found a complete
system for Ethereum development, with debugger, unit testing, sandbox, 
highlighting, integration with frontend, etc. Solidity and web3 are still new
technologies, to say nothing of Ethereum itself. Something as simple as running
something after a transaction is mined requires a framework.

Also, jQuery. I'm sorry dude, but next time I'm using something like angular.js
You're just not suited for this kind of project. I mean, look how many times I 
created elements out of nothing just for a few seconds until a refresh!

I did learn more about fancy web development in five days than in normal months.
If I see one more closure, though, I'm going to put an insult in a variable and 
let it fall into scope.

For everyone who helped me, thanks y'all. I couldn't have done it without you.

This is Smithgift, having regained sanity, finishing this.
